## The signal-cli-rest-api docker container won't start (signal_messenger_signal-cli-rest-api_1 exited with code 0)

If your docker container stops with `signal_messenger_signal-cli-rest-api_1 exited with code 0`, make sure that the host port isn't already occupied by another process (see [here](https://github.com/bbernhard/signal-cli-rest-api/issues/2)).
